How to run the FinalRScript?
- The R script consists of commented code segments as to what each of them do. Simply run the code in RStudio or any other such IDE, 
after the suitable csv files containing the dataset are loaded (By using the fread command/ read.csv command). The output tables are hence obtained.

How to run the python ipynb file?
- This code can be executed by loading it in colab, Jupyter IDE or any such similar python IDE's. 
The preprocessed dataset is given, and the function segments are commented clearly, explaining what each of it does.
